# Dcoder Challenge Write-ups
Yes. This is my write-ups Dcoder Challenge that I've ben solved. \
I used [Python3](https://www.python.org/) to solve them. So if you are not using Python, maybe you can take a look for the logical.

**SPOILER AHEAD!**\
I include the solution too. In Python ofcourse.\
If you want to feel the real challenge, then dont read this write-ups.

## Dcoder Challenge ?
[Dcoder](https://dcoder.tech) is an online compiler, a cloud based IDE for mobile and desktops, where one can code and learn algorithms. Now code, compile, run anytime anywhere. \
**absolutely not copying from their website :smile:* 

In [Dcoder](https://dcoder.tech), there is ranking system based on coder's *EXP*. This EXP can be obtained by solving challenges. The Challenge is categorized by the difficulty of it. But *High Risk High Provit*, the harder one would give you more EXP.

## Isn't This Make Other People Easier To Solve the challenge ?
Well, Yes. But my point here is to share **How I solve that**. \
So, you could think the way i think to solve the challenge. Also, this can be other refference of solving that challenge if you already did.
